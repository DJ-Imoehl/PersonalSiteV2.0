                D.J. grew up in the Driftless Area of Northeast Iowa. During
                high school, he discovered his love for the sciences. Math,
                physics, and computer science were all intriguing subjects, and
                he just wanted to figure out how the world worked around him
                <br /><br />
                This interest led him to double major in Computer Science and
                Physics at Central College. Although the subjects were
                challenging, that challenge excited him even more. Today, he is
                thrilled when given a task he has no idea how to solve.
                <br /><br />
                After college, D.J. worked as a Software Developer for
                FullCount. Here, he has developed his coding abilities and soft
                skills. Notable projects include redesigning and adding data
                visualization to FullCount's existing JapserReports and
                reworking online ordering due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                <br /><br />

              Working at this company was perfect right out of college, but
              after about 3 years he needed a change. A change in his job and a
              change in scenery. The mountains of Colorado were too enthralling
              to ignore, so he signed on for a remote job at Optum and moved to
              the Centennial State.
              <br /><br />
              At Optum, D.J. saw the skills he learned at FullCount thrive. He
              worked in a Scrum environment for the first time, and the
              communication skills he had developed were put to good use. The
              software he worked on helped automate the prior approval process
              for insurance claims, so he found a lot of motivation to improve
              users’ lives in a critical time. He was able to improve the lives
              of his coworkers as well, by championing the development of
              reusable components throughout the application.
              <br /><br />
              Unfortunately, due to economic downturn, his contract was ended at
              Optum. Afterward, he was fortunate to find a job in another
              important field: government grant applications. It doesn’t sound
              flashy, but it is extremely important to get government funds
              where they are needed. He is currently working at GrantSolutions,
              and he is a part of a team dedicated to removing security
              vulnerabilities from all of the company’s applications.
